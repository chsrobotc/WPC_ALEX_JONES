<h3>Candied Bacon</h3>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 pound bacon slices (10 slices)</li>
<li>1/2 cup Demerara sugar</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cook bacon in 2 batches in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, turning over once, until bacon is lightly browned on edges but still flexible, 5 to 6 minutes total per batch. Transfer bacon as cooked to paper towels to drain.
Pour off fat from skillet and arrange bacon in skillet in 1 layer. Sprinkle Demerara sugar over bacon and cook over low heat, turning occasionally with tongs, until sugar is dissolved, caramelized (sugar melts very slowly and burns easily; reduce heat if necessary after sugar begins to caramelize), and coats bacon, 8 to 10 minutes. (Bacon will be dark and look lacquered.) Transfer bacon with tongs to brown paper to cool.<br><br>
Cooks' notes:<br>
·Don't be tempted to transfer bacon to paper towels to drain — the sugar will make the bacon stick to them.<br>
·Bacon can be made 1 day ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature, but it will become less crisp.<br>
·Before cleaning skillet, add a few inches of water to it, then add tongs and boil to dissolve hardened sugar from pan and tongs.
